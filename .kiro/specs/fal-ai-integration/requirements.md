# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the existing FAL AI FLUX Kontext processing capabilities with the main photo editor workflow. Currently, the app has a separate KontextProcessor component that works independently from the main three-panel editor interface. This integration will unify the user experience by connecting the existing image upload, prompt interface, and canvas components with the FAL AI processing backend that's already implemented.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a photo editor user, I want to process my uploaded images using FAL AI directly from the main editor interface, so that I can seamlessly edit photos without switching between different components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image in the main canvas AND enters a prompt in the AI interface THEN the system SHALL process the image using the existing FAL AI kontext endpoint
2. WHEN the FAL AI processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL display loading states in both the canvas and prompt interface
3. WHEN the FAL AI processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the processed image in the canvas
4. WHEN the FAL AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a photo editor user, I want to configure advanced FAL AI parameters like strength and guidance, so that I can fine-tune the AI processing results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the AI prompt interface THEN the system SHALL provide controls for strength and guidance parameters
2. WHEN a user adjusts strength parameter THEN the system SHALL accept values between 0 and 1 with 0.01 precision
3. WHEN a user adjusts guidance parameter THEN the system SHALL accept values between 0 and 10 with 0.1 precision
4. WHEN parameters are not explicitly set THEN the system SHALL use default values (strength: 0.75, guidance: 3.5)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a photo editor user, I want to see before and after versions of my processed images, so that I can compare the original with the AI-enhanced version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed successfully THEN the system SHALL maintain the original image for comparison
2. WHEN a user views processed results THEN the system SHALL provide a way to toggle between original and processed versions
3. WHEN multiple processing operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of processed versions
4. WHEN a user selects a previous version THEN the system SHALL set it as the current working image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a photo editor user, I want to download processed images, so that I can save my AI-enhanced photos locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image has been processed THEN the system SHALL provide a download option in the canvas controls
2. WHEN a user clicks download THEN the system SHALL download the current processed image with appropriate filename
3. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL preserve the original image quality and format when possible
4. IF the processed image format differs from original THEN the system SHALL use a standard format (JPEG/PNG)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a photo editor user, I want the FAL AI integration to work with the existing preset commands, so that I can quickly apply common edits without typing custom prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a preset command badge THEN the system SHALL populate the prompt field with that command
2. WHEN a preset command is selected AND an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL enable the process button
3. WHEN processing with preset commands THEN the system SHALL use the same FAL AI workflow as custom prompts
4. WHEN preset processing completes THEN the system SHALL display results in the same manner as custom prompts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing glassmorphism design and component architecture, so that the integration feels native to the current application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating FAL AI functionality THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing UI components and styling
2. WHEN adding new controls THEN the system SHALL follow the established glassmorphism design patterns
3. WHEN modifying existing components THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current props and interfaces
4. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL use existing UI components from the component library

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a photo editor user, I want proper error handling and user feedback during FAL AI processing, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FAL AI processing fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a retry option
2. WHEN FAL AI processing fails due to invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL display specific parameter validation errors
3. WHEN FAL AI processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated time
4. WHEN FAL_KEY environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate configuration error messages
